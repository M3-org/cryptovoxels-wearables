      "description": "This token was designed for the Regency project in CryptoVoxels. It is intended as a wearable and used as a key to unlock content in Swag0x, Web3vm, CityWide, Bluefin, Airdrop, Underjaw and WorldLaw parcels. It also attaches to additional out-of-game content and qualifies for a free bundle of e-swag that includes a downloadable version of the voxel file and a 32x32 pixel image.\n",
