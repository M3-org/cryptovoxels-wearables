      "description": " Rendar has dipped into the archive and unearthed their Vintage Voxel Tee, much loved by ancestral avatars and shelves of old binary boutiques.\nWe took great pride in the restoration and preparation of this item, to provide your classic tee in the best condition possible. Please know, however, that these pre-owned pixels come with wear and tear consistent with age. Even the toughest Rendar wearables still fall prey to time, light, and space travel.",
