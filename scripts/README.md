# Scripts


## 1. Model Viewer renders

`render.html`

Recommended to use Chromium for the render.html screenshotter so thumbnails automatically download. This script will take a picture of every glb in current directory at a certain angle. Start a web server to use it.

> Special thanks to pigloo for the model-viewer thumbnail generator. 


## 2. Montage tiles

`montage.sh`

This will create a big picture atlas of all the thumbnail previews with the
filename as labels. Recommended to resize all images to power of 2 and to be
small enough resolution to run without crashing.

## 3. Loading bar

`horizontal_scroll.sh`

Will create an mp4 scrolling animation from all the thumbnail pics.
